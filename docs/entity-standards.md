# Entity Standards Documentation

## Industry Research

### Competitor Analysis

#### StudioBinder Approach
- Focuses on traditional production breakdown categories
- Strong distinction between interactive vs static elements
- Notable handling of "silent but significant" characters
- Clear separation between atmosphere and featured extras
- Props classification based on character interaction

#### Filmustage Approach (AI-Driven)
- Uses industry-standard color coding system
- Implements a three-pass identification system
- Emphasis on "hidden requirements" and multiple-version props
- More focused on technical/logistical aspects
- Limited handling of modern production elements

## Proposed Entity Structure

### Cast Categories
1. Speaking Roles
   - Characters with dialogue
   - Primary story drivers

2. Silent Significant
   - No dialogue but plot-relevant
   - Example: "Maggie Simpson" type characters

3. Featured Extras
   - Interactive background characters
   - Specific functions (e.g., "Cashier", "Police Officer")

4. Atmosphere Extras
   - Pure background presence
   - Crowd elements

### Physical Elements

#### Props Classification
1. Pure Props
   - Directly handled/manipulated items
   - Character interaction required

2. Set Dressing
   - Static background elements
   - No significant interaction

3. Transforming Items
   - Set pieces that become props through interaction
   - Context-dependent classification

#### Vehicles
1. Operating Vehicles
   - Plot-relevant transportation
   - Actively used in scenes

2. Background Vehicles
   - Set dressing transportation
   - Static or atmospheric

#### Animals
1. Featured Animals
   - Plot-relevant creatures
   - Specific handling requirements

2. Background Animals/Livestock
   - Atmospheric presence
   - General handling requirements

## Analysis Methodology

### Multi-Pass System
1. Basic Entity Detection
   - Initial identification of core elements
   - Basic categorization

2. Context Analysis
   - Interaction detection
   - State transformation tracking

3. Relationship Detection
   - Entity interconnections
   - Usage patterns and dependencies

## Future Considerations
- Digital/VFX elements integration
- Virtual production elements
- International market variations
- Real-time analysis capabilities
